/*Write a Java program that simulates a simple menu-driven calculator:

Use a String variable to store the user’s name and print a welcome message
Use a switch statement to choose an operation:
1 → Addition
2 → Subtraction
3 → Multiplication
4 → Division
Store two numbers in variables (int)
Use typecasting to ensure division gives a decimal result
Use Math class to:
find the maximum of the two numbers
Use a while loop to allow the user to perform calculations until they choose to exit
Use if-else to:
prevent division by zero
Store the results of each calculation in an array
After exiting, print all stored results using a for loop
